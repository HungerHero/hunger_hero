                        According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, approximately one-third of all food produced in the world is lost or wasted. This amounts to 1.3 billion tons of food that is never consumed, which could feed an estimated 3 billion people.

                        In North America alone, it is estimated that nearly 40% of all food produced is never consumed. This is despite the fact that there are millions of people in the region who suffer from food insecurity and do not have access to adequate nutrition.

                        Food waste is not only a moral issue but also an environmental one. When food is wasted, all the resources that were used to produce it, including land, water, energy, and labor, are also wasted. Additionally, food waste is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change.
